# GenIE
GenIE: Robust Generative Multimodal Document Information Extraction

## Datasets and Pretrained Model
We give an example of processed SROIE dataset with the question prompt to demonstrate how to use GenIE. The dataset is available at this [link](). Our pretrained GenIE will be available at this [link]().

## Environments
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples
```
bash run_scripts/run_example.sh
```

## Acknowledgement
Our code is based on the work of [OFA](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA). We added additional multimodal feature embedding in the encoder as described in the paper.
